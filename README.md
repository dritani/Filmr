“It’s like Tinder, but for movies!”

This is a movie recommendation app with Tinder-like swiping. You first select a mood and the app will present a list of movies that match that feeling. You then swipe left or right depending if you like it or not, and then all your favourite movies are shown in a table.

The app also features a button for changing the background colour.
